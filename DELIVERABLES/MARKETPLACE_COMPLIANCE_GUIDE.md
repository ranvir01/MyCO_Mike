Marketplace Compliance & Appeals – Quick Guide

Purpose
- Reduce risk of account bans/holds; speed up appeals; keep sales channels open.

Core principles
- Use exact legal entity name everywhere (marketplace account, bank, tax, invoices, shipping labels, packing slips).
- Keep addresses consistent and current (business, returns, pickup). No mismatches.
- Verified payments: link bank account that matches legal name; keep reserves in mind.
- ID verification: have government ID and business registration docs ready to upload.
- Invoices/COGS proof: maintain recent supplier invoices with SKU match, dates, amounts; avoid gray-market sources.
- Tracking: always upload tracking with carrier + timestamps; avoid late shipments and cancellations.
- Item accuracy: honest condition grading; no prohibited items; clear photos; serials logged.
- Policy clarity: clear return/warranty terms; consistent handling times; rapid buyer comms.
- Security: 2FA on accounts; limit who has access; rotate strong passwords.

Specific to Mike’s eBay ban
- Issue: account banned for not using legal business name.
- Immediate steps:
  - Prepare correct legal name, EIN, business registration, and matching bank info.
  - Gather photo ID and proof of address.
  - Collect recent supplier invoices for active listings.
  - Draft short appeal noting correction of legal-name mismatch and readiness to verify.
- Paths:
  - Appeal existing account with full docs.
  - If appeal fails, consider new account only after clearance and with full compliance; avoid linked devices/IPs until resolved.

Appeal template (outline)
- Opening: acknowledge suspension reason; state correction (legal name aligned across documents).
- Provide: legal business name, EIN, business registration doc, matching bank account, ID, proof of address, sample invoices for inventory.
- Controls: note process for consistent labeling, verified payments, tracking, and handling times.
- Ask: request review and reinstatement; available for call to verify.

Ongoing hygiene checklist
- Name/address match across marketplace, payment, tax docs, shipping labels.
- Keep invoices (last 6–12 months) organized by SKU; redact pricing only if allowed.
- Daily: track handling time and cancellation rate; respond to buyer messages within 24h.
- Weekly: reconcile payouts vs. orders; check chargebacks/disputes.
- Monthly: review policy updates; rotate passwords/2FA tokens for staff changes.
- New channels: apply same name/address rules for Shopify/local listings; keep return address consistent.

Backups / channel strategy
- Maintain alternate sales channel (website/Shopify/local listings) with compliant info.
- Keep shared inventory ledger to avoid oversells across channels.
