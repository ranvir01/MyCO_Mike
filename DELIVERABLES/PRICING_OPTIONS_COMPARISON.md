## 🗣️ Objection Handling

### "I don't want another monthly bill."
*   **Response:** "Totally get that. The subscription isn't just a bill—it's hiring a Project Manager for $13/day. If we bring in just **4 extra repairs a month**, it pays for itself. Without it, you're managing all this growth alone."

### "Can I just buy the website and business plan?"
*   **Response:** "Yes, absolutely. That's the **Starter Bundle**. It's about $1,600 upfront. We build it, hand it over, and you run with it. The Subscription spreads that cost out and gives you us to help execute it."

### "What if I don't need anything one month?"
*   **Response:** "In the Bronze tier, we pause active development but keep monitoring your metrics and are available for calls. There's always something to optimize—SEO, new flyers, or training your new hire."

### "$400 seems high for consulting."
*   **Response:** "Most consultants charge $150/hour. We're giving you a **full team** for the cost of ~3 hours of consulting a month. We do the work (website, outreach, hiring SOPs) so you don't have to."
