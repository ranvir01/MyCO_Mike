# 1. Executive Summary

## Business Overview

Gadget Fix is a locally-owned phone repair shop located inside the Seattle Exchange at Southcenter, serving Tukwila, WA and the greater South Seattle metro area. We specialize in fast, affordable iPhone screen repairs and battery replacements, delivering quality service with industry-leading turnaround times of 15-30 minutes.

## Mission Statement

*To provide South Seattle residents with fast, affordable, and reliable phone repair services that maximize the value of their devices while delivering exceptional customer experiences.*

## The Trade-In Value Opportunity

Gadget Fix has identified a significant market opportunity: **trade-in value arbitrage**. Many iPhone owners are unaware that repairing a cracked screen before trading in their device can yield substantial financial benefits:

| Scenario | Cracked Value | Repair Cost | Fixed Value | Net Profit |
|----------|---------------|-------------|-------------|------------|
| iPhone 16 Pro Max (Apple) | $168 | $179 | $670 | **+$323** |
| iPhone 16 Pro (Apple) | $150 | $159 | $580 | **+$271** |
| iPhone 15 Pro Max (Apple) | $120 | $149 | $400 | **+$131** |

This "repair before trade-in" strategy provides customers with measurable ROI, differentiating Gadget Fix from competitors focused solely on repair messaging. Apple trade-ins offer the highest values for good-condition phones but also penalize damage the most—creating the biggest opportunity for pre-repair profit.

## Financial Highlights

| Metric | Current State | 6-Month Goal | 12-Month Goal |
|--------|---------------|--------------|---------------|
| Weekly Repairs | 3 | 7 | 10+ |
| Monthly Revenue | $1,300 | $3,100 | $4,800 |
| Annual Revenue | $15,600 | $37,200 | $57,600 |

## Growth Goals

1. **Triple weekly repair volume** from 3 to 10+ repairs/week within 12 months
2. **Establish carrier partnerships** with 2-3 local wireless retailers
3. **Build online presence** with optimized website and Google Business profile
4. **Achieve 30% of revenue** from partnership referrals

## Break-Even Analysis

### Monthly Fixed Costs (Estimated)

| Expense | Amount |
|---------|--------|
| Rent/Marketplace Fee | $800 |
| Utilities (included) | $0 |
| Insurance | $150 |
| Marketing | $200 |
| Software/Tools | $50 |
| Miscellaneous | $100 |
| **Total Fixed Costs** | **$1,300** |

### Break-Even Calculation

```
Total Fixed Costs:        $1,300/month
Average Ticket:           $130
Parts Cost (30%):         $39
Gross Profit per Repair:  $91

Break-Even Repairs = $1,300 ÷ $91 = 14.3 repairs/month
                   = 3.6 repairs/week

Current volume (3/week) is AT break-even
Target volume (10/week) would generate $3,640/month gross profit
                        = $2,340/month profit after fixed costs
```

**Key Insight:** Reaching 10 repairs/week would generate $2,340/month in net profit

## Key Assumptions

1. **Market assumptions:**
   - iPhone ownership remains strong in Seattle area
   - Carrier trade-in programs continue or expand
   - Competitors do not significantly reduce prices

2. **Operational assumptions:**
   - Mike can handle up to 15 repairs/week solo
