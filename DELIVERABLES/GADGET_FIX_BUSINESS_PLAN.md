# 1. Executive Summary

## Business Overview

Gadget Fix is a locally-owned phone repair shop serving the Kent, WA and greater South Seattle metro area. We specialize in fast, affordable iPhone screen repairs and battery replacements, delivering quality service with industry-leading turnaround times of 15-30 minutes.

## Mission Statement

*To provide Kent-area residents with fast, affordable, and reliable phone repair services that maximize the value of their devices while delivering exceptional customer experiences.*

## The Trade-In Value Opportunity

Gadget Fix has identified a significant market opportunity: **trade-in value arbitrage**. Many iPhone owners are unaware that repairing a cracked screen before trading in their device can yield substantial financial benefits:

| Scenario | Investment | Return | Net Benefit |
|----------|------------|--------|-------------|
| iPhone 16 Pro Max | $150 repair | +$300 trade-in value | **+$150 profit** |
| iPhone 16 Pro | $140 repair | +$280 trade-in value | **+$140 profit** |
| iPhone 16 | $120 repair | +$220 trade-in value | **+$100 profit** |

This "repair before trade-in" strategy provides customers with measurable ROI, differentiating Gadget Fix from competitors focused solely on repair messaging.

## Financial Highlights

| Metric | Current State | 6-Month Goal | 12-Month Goal |
|--------|---------------|--------------|---------------|
| Weekly Repairs | 3 | 7 | 10+ |
| Monthly Revenue | $1,300 | $3,100 | $4,800 |
| Annual Revenue | $15,600 | $37,200 | $57,600 |

## Growth Goals

1. **Triple weekly repair volume** from 3 to 10+ repairs/week within 12 months
2. **Establish carrier partnerships** with 2-3 local wireless retailers
3. **Build online presence** with optimized website and Google Business profile
4. **Achieve 30% of revenue** from partnership referrals

| **Year 1 Total** | **Avg: 8.6** | **$112** | **$50,575** |

## Break-Even Analysis

### Monthly Fixed Costs (Estimated)

| Expense | Amount |
|---------|--------|
| Rent | [PLACEHOLDER: $XXX] |
| Utilities | $100 |
| Insurance | $150 |
| Marketing | $200 |
| Software/Tools | $50 |
| Miscellaneous | $100 |
| **Total Fixed Costs** | **$600 + Rent** |

### Break-Even Calculation

```
Assuming rent of $1,500/month:
Total Fixed Costs:        $2,100/month
Average Ticket:           $100
Parts Cost (35%):         $35
Gross Profit per Repair:  $65

Break-Even Repairs = $2,100 ÷ $65 = 32.3 repairs/month
                   = 8 repairs/week

Current volume (3/week) is BELOW break-even if rent is $1,500
Target volume (10/week) would generate $2,600/month gross profit
                        = $500/month profit after fixed costs
```

**Key Insight:** Reaching 10 repairs/week is critical for sustainable profitability

## Key Assumptions

1. **Market assumptions:**
   - iPhone ownership remains strong in Kent area
   - Carrier trade-in programs continue or expand
   - Competitors do not significantly reduce prices

2. **Operational assumptions:**
   - Mike can handle up to 15 repairs/week solo
   - Part supply chain remains stable
   - Part costs remain stable (±10%)

3. **Marketing assumptions:**
   - Google Business profile achieves local visibility within 3 months
   - At least 1 carrier partnership established by Month 4
   - Website generates measurable traffic by Month 2

4. **Financial assumptions:**
   - Rent remains stable during projection period
