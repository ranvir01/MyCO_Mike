## The Opportunity: Trade-In Value Arbitrage

Gadget Fix has identified a significant market opportunity that no local competitor is leveraging: **trade-in value arbitrage**.

Many iPhone owners are unaware that repairing a cracked screen before trading in their device can yield substantial financial benefits:

| Repair Investment | Trade-In Value Increase | Net Customer Benefit |
|-------------------|------------------------|---------------------|
| $150 (iPhone 16 Pro Max) | +$300 | **+$150 profit** |
| $140 (iPhone 16 Pro) | +$280 | **+$140 profit** |
| $120 (iPhone 16) | +$220 | **+$100 profit** |

This "repair before trade-in" strategy provides customers with measurable ROI, differentiating Gadget Fix from every competitor focused solely on repair messaging.

**Our unique value proposition:**
> *"Don't Just Fix Your Phone—Profit From It"*
