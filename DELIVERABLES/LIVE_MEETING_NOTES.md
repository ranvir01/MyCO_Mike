# 3. 🧠 CONTEXT & STRATEGY (Reference Material)

## 📊 Business Snapshot (Agent 2 Data)
*   **Current State:** ~3 repairs/week | ~$1,300/mo revenue | Sole Prop
*   **Goal State:** 10+ repairs/week | ~$4,800/mo revenue | Partnership-driven
*   **Core Strategy:** **Trade-In Arbitrage.** Position repair as a way to unlock $200+ in trade-in value.

## 💰 The "Arbitrage" Pitch (Data for Mike)
*Show this to prove the value:*

| Scenario | iPhone 16 Pro Max Value | Net Result |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trade-in Cracked** | $168 (Low carrier offer) | Customer loses value |
| **Trade-in Fixed** | $670 (Full carrier offer) | **+$502 Value** |
| **Repair Cost** | -$179 (Paid to Mike) | **Revenue for Mike** |
| **CUSTOMER PROFIT** | **+$323 (Net Gain)** | **Win-Win** |

## 📱 Carrier Partnership Strategy (Agent 4)
*   **The Pitch to Managers:** "Don't turn away cracked phones. Send them to us for a 15-min fix, and they come back to you ready to upgrade. You save the sale."
*   **Target List (Taylor):**
    1.  T-Mobile (Kent Station)
    2.  Verizon (Kent)
    3.  AT&T (Kent)
    4.  Best Buy / Costco (Secondary)

## 💲 Proposal & Pricing Options (Agent 6)
*We are recommending the Bronze Tier + Starter Bundle.*

| Package | Cost | What's Included |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Bronze Subscription** | **$400/mo** | 1 Project/mo, Monthly Strategy Call, PM Access. |
| **Starter Bundle** | **$660 (One-time)** | Professional Website ($100), Business Plan ($500), Setup ($60). |
| **Partnership Ops** | **$560 (Optional)** | Taylor's outreach (10+ store visits), materials, tracking. |

## 🛡️ Marketplace Compliance Guide
*   **Root Issue:** eBay ban for Legal Business Name mismatch.
*   **Immediate Fix:**
    1.  Legal Name/EIN doc.
    2.  Matching Bank Info.
    3.  Supplier Invoices (recent).
    4.  Photo ID.
*   **Strategy:** Appeal first. If denied, clean slate (new IP/device/account) ONLY after rigorous prep.
