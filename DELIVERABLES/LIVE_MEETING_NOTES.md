# 🧠 GADGET FIX: MASTER STRATEGY & MEETING DASHBOARD
> **Live Status:** PRE-LAUNCH | **Meeting:** Friday, 3:00 PM @ Kent

**Instructions:** This is the project's "brain." Use it to reference our strategy, show data to Mike, and log pivots live.

# 1. 🎯 THE NORTH STAR (Goals)
We are not just building a website. We are building a **growth engine** based on one core insight: **Trade-In Arbitrage**.

*   **Current Reality:** ~3 repairs/week | ~$1,300/mo revenue | Sole Prop.
*   **90-Day Target:** 10+ repairs/week | ~$4,800/mo revenue | Partnership-driven.
*   **The Big Win:** Establish Gadget Fix as the "Pre-Trade-In" destination for Kent.

# 2. 💡 THE CORE STRATEGY: "FIX IT TO FLIP IT"
*Why customers will care (and why Mike wins).*

### The Logic (Show this to Mike)
Most people trade in cracked phones for pennies. We show them the math:

| Device Scenario (iPhone 16 Pro Max) | Value | Outcome |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Option A: Trade in Cracked** | **$168** | Customer loses huge value. |
| **Option B: Fix with Mike ($179)** | **$670** | Trade-in value jumps +$502. |
| **NET CUSTOMER PROFIT** | **+$323** | **Customer KEEPS $323 after paying Mike.** |

**Our Job:** Get this message in front of people *before* they walk into Verizon.

# 3. ⚔️ BATTLE PLAN: EXECUTION TRACKS

### 🅰️ TRACK 1: DIGITAL PRESENCE (Ranvir/Ben)
*   **Website:** Mobile-first landing page. **Status:** Ready for launch.
    *   *Key Feature:* "Click to Call" & "Check Your Savings" calculator.
*   **SEO/Reviews:** Optimizing "iPhone Repair Kent" to capture high-intent searchers.
*   **Social:** "Did you know?" posts showing the trade-in math.

### 🅱️ TRACK 2: CARRIER PARTNERSHIPS (Taylor)
*   **The Pitch:** "Don't lose the upgrade sale because of a cracked screen. Send them to us (15 mins away), we fix it, they come back to you to buy the new phone."
*   **Target List (Kent Area):**
    1.  T-Mobile (Kent Station) - *Primary Target*
    2.  Verizon (Central Ave)
    3.  AT&T (Mall)
    4.  Best Buy / Costco (Secondary)
*   **Incentive:** Optional $5-10 referral bonus per head (if Mike agrees).

### 🆎 TRACK 3: OPS & COMPLIANCE (Ethan/Ranvir)
*   **eBay Ban:** Immediate appeal using legal entity docs.
    *   *Plan B:* New clean account if appeal fails.
*   **Hiring:** New front-desk hire needs SOPs for intake/hand-off.
