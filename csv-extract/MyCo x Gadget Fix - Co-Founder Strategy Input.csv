I think if Mike signs up with a Bronze subscription with us ($400/month for the whole year) he can just offload all the projects he would like to get done for us to implement for him. He had the idea of wanting to have us make his business plan and for us to help him create and implement an advertising strategy. There are many ways we can do this and it is up to us to figure out for him. With the Bronze plan we will be constantly going through the project initiation and planning stages and figuring out what projects we could do for him. At this point I think we can make a quick business plan for him so he has all of his business captured and organized for his documentation. Additionally for the advertising strategy, Mike proposed we explore finding ways to communicate the value of phone screen repairs to customers so that they come to mike to repair their phone screen first and then use that to have a high trade in value. We did some feasibility analysis for free and I had one of our analyst, Taylor, do a price analysis of iphone trade in values with different models, different carriers (AT&T, BestBuy, ect.) and different phone conditions.The insights were that iphone 12 and under are basically worthless for trade ins (even mint condition) and becomes actually viable at the iphone 15 and upwards. We now know the parameters for the STP for this potential advertising/marketing strategy: the target demographic are any people that own the iphone 16 looking to get an iphone 17 with a crack in their phone screen as the trade in value is ~$500. This is the value to the customer that we would need to communicate to them in an effective marketing strategy. We still need Mike to tell us his costs for these phone repairs, the competitors prices, the customers Willingness to Pay for phone screen repairs and then the strategy + implementation that gets them into Mikes repair shop. There are 3 projects that can come of this: 1. Competitor price analysis (go to all local repair shops and gather data on their phone screen repair prices, so that way Mike knows how much is competitive), 2.Customer Willingness to Pay (WTP) analysis (design and test a survey which determines how much potential customers would even be willing to pay for a phone screen repair (both knowing and not knowing about the benefit of arbitraging a trade in), 3. Advertising Strategy; however we need to do more feasibility analysis on what exact strategy would be good here. For example we could do a social media strategy where we post content promoting Mikes shop for doing phone screen repairs and the benefit of doing so.This can then be published on platforms like Facebook, Tiktok, ect. Another thing we could do would be a direct marketing strategy where we could stand in a public place and have a sign saying ""Phone screen broke? Talk to us"" and we just hang around and have people aprroach us and then we inform them about going to Mike and the benefit of repairing their phone screen before trading it in. The other strategy could be for a Referral Partner strategy where we approach carriers like Verizon and AT&T and try to establish relationships on behalf of Mikes shop to have them send their customers to Mike whenever a customer wanted to do a trade in but their screen is broken. We do not know exactly what would be the best approach yet and so we need to spend a little bit of time doing each testing each approach, gathering the necessary data, then fully tying out the strategy that has the highest likelihood of succeeding.We do not know exactly what would be the best approach yet and so we need to spend a little bit of time doing each testing each approach, gathering the necessary data, then fully tying out the strategy that has the highest likelihood of succeeding. Our strategy could be any of the 3 I just described, but the issue is we need more data and we need to try out what works more flexibly. We might want to have him make his website first and then use that as a part of our social media strategy for example. We do not know and no one honestly knows what the best answer is. Mike doesnt have all the insights or the experience with different marketing strategies, a professional marketing firm would not know either because what works for one business (even if it is exactly the same) might not work for Mikes unique business, situation and desire, even we do not know. All we know is that we need to be methodical, take decisions one step at a time, do not force mike to overcommit to something that might not work...which is why the bronze tier would make sense for him. It fairly comepensates us for caring about Mikes problem and helping him overcome this issue or pivot to an entirely new direction if that becomes what is obvious to do. This saves Mike money, time, and gives him real time value which we incure cost as they come.","Full-service approach (all of the above)","","3","We do not know if this would work. The unknown limitations are that 1. these companies may already have a computer repair partner, 2. have a lengthy and bureaucratic process for establishing the partnership, 3. be too difficult to pitch these businesses. We do not know how much it will cost us nor do we know if it will help Mike. I do not want us and Mike to come to a conclusion on this is exactly what we do and budget for it and then find out that this is NOT what we should do. It would have wasted everyones time. We should do a sample of this as apart of the feasibility analysis on some kind of subscription plan. It could work....","Carrier stores (Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile, Xfinity);Big box stores (Costco, Walmart, Target);Insurance companies (phone insurance claims);Corporate IT departments;Schools / School districts","","From the feasibility analysis we discover that this might actually work well and work better than the other approaches, we would have Taylor, our analyst, be the consultant for this project with me as the project manager. In this project we will have Taylor for roughly 2 hours to compile a list of the businesses he wants to target. He will spend another 4 hours to create, refine, and practice an exact pitch of what he will say to these business owners. We will then budget 10 hours for Taylor to go to shops and see if he can get them to agree. This project will cost Mike no more than $560 for Taylor to complete these deliverables. If it takes taylor less time to do this then it will cost less. At the end of the project, MyCo will send an invoice to Mike.","Yes - it's a significant effort, charge separately","I think we charge mike for the subscription and then propose several projects he can do. His website should be $100 + $20/month in ongoing maintenance (just because Mike said he was going to do it himself we cannot charge to much). The referral partnership marketing strategy should come to be around $560. The business plan $500. The other marketing strategies should be around $500 as well.","Other (explain below)","PMaaS subscription + one time project fees to start then ongoing hourly if Mike wants us to continue with the sales project for example","2","4","2","2","2","1 - Most","There are things such as a commercial location project (he might get evicted from his current place and might need to find another place that we could help him with). There are other things he will need like finding new employees and finding a 2nd location that we will eventually help him with once he is ready to tackle those hurdles.","Ranvir (website + software), Ben (marketing), Taylor (sales or real estate analysis), Ethan (operations (later))","project based","Yes but don't discount - just prioritize quality","Explain why the PMaaS subscription would work great with him since he has a lot of work he would like to get done + definitely uncertainty of what will work for his business","","Yes - both of us should be there","","Nothing, Mike is great","he is our first real client since changing the business model so we still dont know if we are under or overvaluing ourselves","Yes - great fit, let's prioritize him","","him to prioritizing gathering data so he can make a good decision on what to prioritize","very big stepping stone. Mike wants to refer us to a ton of business owners he knows.","","Yes","Maybe - need to scope it first","Just a mockup is fine","Next week","We will have Ben (other co founder) + Taylor (our analyst) there at the in person meeting","Yes - let's schedule a call"
