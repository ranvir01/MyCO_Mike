# 📬 EMAIL 1: THE OPENING PLAY
## Send: TODAY

---

**To:** Mike  
**Subject:** Quick intro + something we built for Gadget Fix 🔧

---

Hey Mike,

Hope this message finds you well. It was fun learning about your business and me and Ethan are looking forward to working with you.

I wanted to reach out because we've been exploring your space, and honestly, we got a little excited. We put together some ideas for Gadget Fix that I think you'll want to see.

---

### 📺 FIRST — WATCH THIS (5 MIN)

Before anything else, check out this quick video about who we are and how we work:

**[LOOM VIDEO LINK]**  
*Our approach, our team, and why we're different.*

---

### 💡 WHAT WE'VE DISCOVERED

While researching your market, we uncovered something significant:

> **Your customers with cracked screens are losing up to $500 on their phone trade-ins — and they don't even know it.**

We ran the numbers across Apple, AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, and Best Buy. The data is compelling. A $179 screen repair can put **$323 back in your customer's pocket** when they trade in at Apple.

That's not just a repair — that's a story. A marketing hook. A partnership opportunity.

We want to help you own this.
