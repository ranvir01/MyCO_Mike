## 📉 DAMAGED SCREEN VALUE CALCULATIONS

### Methodology Verification
Apple and carriers typically apply these damage multipliers:

| Carrier | Good → Damaged Reduction | Calculation Method |
|---------|--------------------------|-------------------|
| **Apple** | ~75% reduction | Good × 0.25 = Damaged |
| **Verizon** | ~50% reduction | Good × 0.50 = Damaged |
| **AT&T** | ~50% reduction | Good × 0.50 = Damaged |
| **T-Mobile** | ~50% reduction | Good × 0.50 = Damaged |
| **Best Buy** | ~25% reduction | Good × 0.75 = Damaged |

### Verification: Taylor's Numbers vs. Expected Calculations

#### iPhone 16 Pro Max (256GB)

| Carrier | Taylor's Good | Taylor's Damaged | Expected Damaged | Match? |
|---------|---------------|------------------|------------------|--------|
