# 📊 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

## The Opportunity

Mike owns **Gadget Fix**, a phone repair shop in Kent, WA. He's looking for help with:
- Creating a business plan
- Developing an advertising/marketing strategy
- Building a website
- Establishing carrier partnerships for referrals

## The MyCo Value Proposition

We've identified a **unique trade-in value arbitrage opportunity** (✅ VERIFIED DATA):
- iPhone 16 Pro Max with cracked screen: **$168** at Apple
- iPhone 16 Pro Max with fixed screen: **$670** at Apple
- Mike's repair cost: **$179**
- **Customer profit: $323 after repair** (up to **$502 value swing!**)

This is the cornerstone of our marketing strategy.

## Recommended Approach (per Ethan's input)

- **Bronze Subscription ($600/month, 1-year commitment)**
- **Project-based add-ons** for specific deliverables
- **PMaaS model** - we do the thinking, Mike gets results

# 🤝 CO-FOUNDER STRATEGY ALIGNMENT

## Ethan's Key Insights (from Strategy Input CSV)

### Best Way to Help Mike
> "Do the thinking for him and give him manpower. Bronze subscription ($600/month for the year) lets him offload projects for us to implement."

### Marketing Strategy Analysis
- **Target Demographic:** iPhone 16 owners looking to upgrade to iPhone 17
- **Key Insight:** iPhone 12 and under = worthless for trade-ins
- **Sweet Spot:** iPhone 15+ with cracked screens

### Three Potential Marketing Approaches

1. **Social Media Strategy** - Content promoting repair + trade-in benefit
2. **Direct Marketing** - Public outreach ("Phone screen broke? Talk to us")
3. **Referral Partner Strategy** - Carrier stores (Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile)

### Ethan's Pricing Recommendations

| Deliverable | Price |
|------------|-------|
| Website | $100 + $20/month maintenance |
| Referral Partnership Project | ~$560 (Taylor's time) |
| Business Plan | ~$500 |
| Marketing Strategy | ~$500 |

### Partnership Targets (Ethan's List)

- Carrier stores (Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile, Xfinity)
- Big box stores (Costco, Walmart, Target)
- Insurance companies (phone insurance claims)
- Corporate IT departments
- Schools / School districts

### Meeting Strategy

**DO:**
- Explain why PMaaS subscription works for his situation
- Emphasize uncertainty - we test and learn together
- Show we've already done feasibility analysis

**DON'T:**
- Overcommit to a strategy that might not work
- Force Mike into expensive fixed-price contracts

# 🎬 LOOM PITCH VIDEO RECOMMENDATIONS

## Current State: 77 Slides (~13-15 min video)

Based on my review of all slides, here's the structure:

| Section | Slides | Time Est. | Content |
|---------|--------|-----------|---------|
| Our Story | 1-8 | ~2 min | Title, Founders, Clients |
| Our Service | 9-55 | ~7 min | Process, Lifecycle, Scoping (very detailed) |
| Our Price | 56-77 | ~4 min | Pricing, Projects, Examples |

## Target: 5-Minute Video

### 🟢 KEEP (Essential - ~2 min)

| Slide | Content | Why Keep |
|-------|---------|----------|
| 1 | Title - MyConsulting Network | Strong branding |
| 3 | Meet our Founders | Personal connection, trust |
| 5 | Meet our Clients | Social proof, credibility |
| 65 | Pricing Breakdown | Core value prop, clear tiers |
| 70 | Sample Project Formation | Shows tangible deliverables |

### 🟡 REDO/CONDENSE (Combine into 1-2 slides - ~1.5 min)

| Current Slides | Recommendation |
|----------------|----------------|
| 10-15 (Who we are/Why us) | Condense to ONE slide: "What makes us different" |
| 20 (Examples) | Keep 2 best testimonials, not all |
| 25-55 (Process - 30 slides!) | MAJOR CUT: Reduce to 2-3 slides max |
| 60 (Contract Terms) | Move to end or remove - too early |

### 🔴 CUT COMPLETELY

| Slides | Reason |
|--------|--------|
| 30-55 | Process is way too detailed for a pitch video |
| 45 (Project Scoping diagrams) | Too academic/corporate |
| 75-77 | Blue Landscaping case study - good but too long |

## Recommended 5-Minute Structure (12-15 slides)

```
1. HOOK (30 sec) - Slides 1-2
   ├── Title slide
   └── "Have a problem? Call us." (one-liner)

2. CREDIBILITY (45 sec) - Slides 3-5
   ├── Meet the Founders
   ├── Meet our Clients (logos)
   └── Quick testimonial

3. VALUE PROP (60 sec) - Slides 6-8
   ├── "Why do it like this?" (condensed)
   ├── Our Process (ONE SLIDE - simplified)
   └── "We do the thinking, you get results"

4. PRICING (60 sec) - Slides 9-11
   ├── Pricing Breakdown (tiers)
   ├── What's Included
   └── Sample Project (one example)

5. CTA (45 sec) - Slides 12-13
   ├── "Ready to start?"
   └── Contact info + next steps
```

## Specific Slide Changes

### Slide to REDO: "Our Process" 
**Current:** 20+ slides with complex flowcharts
**New:** ONE slide with 4 simple steps:
```
1. You Tell Us the Problem
2. We Research & Plan  
3. We Execute
4. You Get Results
```

### Slide to ADD: "Mike's Story" (if customizing for Mike)
```
"Mike runs a phone repair shop in Kent.
He wanted more customers.
We found an opportunity worth $300/customer.
Now we're building his growth engine."
```

### Key Changes from Original Form:

1. **Simplified** - Removed redundant questions
2. **Focused on trade-in data** - We need accurate pricing for the calculator
3. **Added partnership questions** - For Taylor's outreach
4. **Added priority rankings** - To guide our focus
5. **Removed unnecessary sections** - Current marketing (we already know), complex logistics
6. **Friendlier tone** - More casual, less corporate

**Caption:**

WAIT. Read this before you trade in your phone. 👇

I had a customer last week with an iPhone 16 Pro.
Cracked screen. Apple offered them $180.

20 minutes later? Screen fixed.
New trade-in offer? $520.

They spent $150. Made $340.

That's not a repair. That's a profit.

**Slide 1:**
```
"My cracked screen doesn't matter if I'm trading it in anyway"

Wrong. Here's why. 👉
```

**Slide 2:**
```
THE MATH:

iPhone 16 (cracked): $200 trade-in
iPhone 16 (fixed): $480 trade-in
───────────────────
Difference: $280

Your repair cost: $140
YOUR PROFIT: $140 💰
```

**Slide 3:**
```
But it gets better...

That $140 profit?
It's CASH you keep.

The repair takes 20 minutes.
You wait.
We work.
You profit.
```

### Post 3: The Skeptic Buster 🤔
**Platform:** Facebook  
**Type:** Text-Heavy Post  
**Best Time:** Friday 6:00 PM

**Caption:**
```
"Yeah but... is it really worth fixing a cracked screen?"

I hear this all the time. Let me break it down:

❌ What people THINK:
"I'll just trade it in cracked, whatever."

✅ What ACTUALLY happens:
→ Carrier sees crack
→ Offers you minimum value
→ You lose $200-400
→ You shrug and accept it

Here's the alternative:

🔧 15-minute repair at Gadget Fix
📱 Phone looks brand new
💰 Full trade-in value restored
🎉 You pocket the difference

Real example from this week:
• iPhone 15 Pro Max — cracked
• Trade-in before repair: $320
• Trade-in after $160 repair: $650
• Customer's profit: $170

That's a free AirPods. Or a nice dinner. Or just... money.

Your call.

20 minutes. That's it.

BEFORE: Spider web screen, barely usable
AFTER: Crystal clear, like-new

This iPhone 16 came in yesterday afternoon. Customer said they'd been putting it off for months.

"I didn't think it was worth fixing since I'm upgrading soon anyway."

Then I showed them the math:

Cracked trade-in: ~$200
Fixed trade-in: ~$480
Repair cost: $140

They're upgrading next month with an extra $140 in their pocket.

Same story, different customer, every single day.

🤷 "I don't know"

At Gadget Fix, every repair comes with a 90-day warranty. Period.

That means:
✓ Screen issues? We fix it free

We're not some random mall kiosk. We're your neighbors. We live here. Our reputation matters.

**Caption:**
```
Hey Kent 👋

I'm Mike, owner of Gadget Fix at Kent Station.

Just wanted to pop in and say thanks. 

This community has been incredible. Every cracked screen I fix, every customer who walks out with a working phone — it reminds me why I love what I do.

Quick thing I've been telling people lately:

If you're planning to upgrade your phone in 2025, don't trade it in with a cracked screen. You're leaving money on the table. Seriously — sometimes $200-400.

Come see me first. I'll show you the math. No pressure, just honest advice.

And if you've already been in? Thank you. If you could leave a quick Google review, it helps more than you know.

Here for you,
Mike @ Gadget Fix

**Type:** Relatable Humor  
**Best Time:** Thursday 7:00 PM

**Caption (for static version):**
```
POV: You're trading in your phone

THEM: "We can give you $180 for this iPhone 16"

YOU: "But it's only 6 months old!"

THEM: *points at crack* "Policy."

————————

Meanwhile, the person who came to Gadget Fix first:

THEM: "We can give you $520 for this iPhone 16"

THEM: "Wow, it's in great condition!"

————————

Same phone. Different outcome.

The difference? 20 minutes and $140 at Gadget Fix.

Don't be the first person. Be the second person.

Hey [First Name]!

Thanks for connecting with Gadget Fix. I'm Mike — I run the shop here in Kent Station.

Quick question: 

Do you have a cracked screen on your phone right now?

If yes, there's something you should know before your next upgrade.

When you trade in a phone with a cracked screen, carriers dock you BIG. 
We're talking $200-400 less than what you'd get with a clean screen.

Here's where it gets interesting:

A screen repair at my shop costs $100-180 depending on your phone.
And it takes about 15-30 minutes.

The math usually looks like this:

┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ iPhone 16 Example                   │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Trade-in (cracked):     $200        │
│ Trade-in (fixed):       $480        │
│ Your repair cost:      -$140        │
│ ─────────────────────────────────   │
│ YOUR PROFIT:            $140 💰     │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

Hey [First Name],

Planning to upgrade your phone in 2025?

Before you head to the Apple Store or your carrier, I need to tell you something.

If your screen is cracked, you're about to leave money on the table.

Here's what happens:

1. You walk in to trade your phone
2. They see the cracked screen
3. They offer you minimum value ($150-250)
4. You shrug and take it
5. You walk out having lost $200-400

Here's the smarter play:

1. You stop by Gadget Fix first (15-20 min repair)
2. You walk into the carrier with a pristine phone
3. They offer you FULL trade-in value ($400-650)
4. You just profited $100-200+
5. You walk out smarter than everyone else

The numbers for January 2025:

┌───────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Model          │ Cracked │ Fixed  │ Diff  │
├───────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ iPhone 16 PM   │ $350    │ $680   │ +$330 │
│ iPhone 16 Pro  │ $280    │ $580   │ +$300 │
│ iPhone 16      │ $200    │ $480   │ +$280 │
│ iPhone 15 Pro  │ $180    │ $450   │ +$270 │
└───────────────────────────────────────────┘

*Trade-in values vary by carrier. Use our calculator for exact numbers.
