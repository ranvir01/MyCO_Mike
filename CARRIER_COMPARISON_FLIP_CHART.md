## 📋 Page 5: "Worth It?" Decision Guide

### ✅ REPAIR BEFORE TRADE-IN — YES!

| Phone Model | Repair Cost | Trade-In At | Expected Profit |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|-----------------|
| iPhone 16 Pro Max | $179 | Apple | **+$323** |
| iPhone 16 Pro | $159 | Apple | **+$276** |
| iPhone 15 Plus | $129 | Apple | **+$118** |
| iPhone 15 Pro | ~$149 | Apple | **+$80-150** |
| iPhone 14 Pro Max | ~$139 | Apple | **+$70-130** |
| iPhone 13 Pro Max | $119 | Apple | **+$106** |

### ⚠️ MAYBE — CHECK NUMBERS FIRST

| Phone Model | Notes |
|-------------|-------|
| iPhone 14/14 Plus | May break even at Apple |
| iPhone 13/13 mini | Marginal profit at Apple only |
| Any phone → AT&T/Verizon | Usually break-even or small profit |

### ❌ DON'T REPAIR FOR TRADE-IN

| Phone Model | Why Not |
|-------------|---------|
| iPhone 12 and older | Trade values too low |
| Any phone → Best Buy | Their cracked value is close to fixed value |
| Any phone → T-Mobile (older) | Small difference doesn't cover repair |

### 💡 ALTERNATIVE FOR OLDER PHONES

For iPhone 12 and older:
1. **Fix it** and keep using it, OR
2. **Fix it** and sell privately on Facebook/Craigslist
3. Trade-in value just isn't there anymore

## 📋 Quick Sales Scripts

### When Customer Has iPhone 16 Pro/Max:
> "Great news! If I fix your screen for $179, Apple will give you $670 instead of $168. That's **$323 in your pocket** after paying for the repair!"

### When Customer Has iPhone 15:
> "With your iPhone 15, fixing the screen means Apple will pay you $330 instead of $83. After the $129 repair, you're ahead **$118**."

### When Customer Has iPhone 13 Pro Max:
> "For your 13 Pro Max, Apple's trade-in jumps from $75 to $300 after repair. That's **$106 profit** after the $119 repair cost."

### When Customer Has iPhone 12 or Older:
> "For iPhone 12 and older, the trade-in values are pretty low across the board. I'd recommend either keeping it as a backup phone after repair, or fixing it and selling privately — you'll get more that way."

> "Best Buy actually doesn't penalize cracked screens as much, so the repair doesn't help you there. Apple gives you the biggest boost for having a phone in good condition."
