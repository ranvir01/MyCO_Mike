# SECTION 1: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

## The Opportunity

Every day, customers walk into carrier stores wanting to upgrade their phones. But there's a problem: **their screens are cracked**. The carrier either rejects the trade-in or offers a fraction of the phone's real value. The customer leaves frustrated. The store loses the sale.

**This is your opportunity.**

Gadget Fix solves this problem. A quick 15-30 minute screen repair transforms a rejected trade-in into a full-value transaction. Everyone wins.

---

## The Numbers That Matter

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Trade-in value swing** | Up to $502 difference |
| **Customer profit after repair** | $66 - $323 depending on model |
| **Repair time** | 15-30 minutes |
| **Your repair cost** | $119 - $179 |

### Real Example: iPhone 16 Pro Max

# SECTION 2: THE STRATEGY

## The Win-Win-Win Framework

Every successful partnership creates value for all parties. Here's how this works:

### For the Carrier Store
| Benefit | Why It Matters |
|---------|----------------|
| Complete more upgrade sales | Don't lose customers to cracked screens |
| Happier customers | They feel you helped them get a better deal |
| No cost to store | Zero risk partnership |
| Optional referral bonus | Extra income for employees |

### For the Customer
| Benefit | Why It Matters |
|---------|----------------|
| Higher trade-in value | $100-$500 more in their pocket |
| Quick repair | 15-30 minutes, same day |
| Professional service | Quality parts, real warranty |
| Easy process | Walk to Gadget Fix, walk back |

### For Gadget Fix
| Benefit | Why It Matters |
|---------|----------------|
| Steady customer stream | Pre-qualified, ready-to-buy customers |
| Higher conversion rate | They already understand the value |
| Partnership validation | Builds credibility and trust |
| Predictable revenue | Recurring referral channel |

---

## Target Stores

### Priority 1: Carrier Stores (Highest Value)
These stores deal with trade-ins daily and have the most to gain.

| Store | Priority | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| T-Mobile Kent Station | HIGH | High traffic, upgrade-focused |
| Verizon Kent | HIGH | Corporate store, may have more rules |
| AT&T Kent | HIGH | Often has authorized retailers nearby |
| Xfinity Mobile Kent | MEDIUM | Newer to market, may be more open |

### Priority 2: Big Box Retailers
Higher volume but more corporate oversight.

| Store | Priority | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Best Buy Kent | MEDIUM | Has Geek Squad but different service |
| Costco Kent | MEDIUM | Membership-based, loyal customers |
| Walmart Kent | LOW | High volume, harder to reach decision-maker |
| Target Kent | LOW | Mobile kiosk, often staffed by carrier reps |

### Priority 3: Other Opportunities

| Store Type | Notes |
|------------|-------|
| Phone case stores/kiosks | Often in malls, see damaged phones |
| Insurance claim centers | Customers with damaged phones |
| Pawn shops | Buy phones, need them repaired |
| Used phone stores | Similar to pawn shops |

---

## Visit Schedule Template (Week 1)

| Day | Stores to Visit | Goal |
|-----|-----------------|------|
| **Tuesday** | T-Mobile, Verizon | 2 carrier stores |
| **Wednesday** | AT&T, Xfinity | 2 carrier stores |
| **Thursday** | Best Buy, Costco | 2 big box |
| **Friday** | Follow-up calls | Confirm any pending decisions |

---

# SECTION 3: PRE-VISIT PREPARATION

## Materials Checklist

Before leaving for store visits, ensure you have:

### Essential Materials
- [ ] **Flyers:** 5-10 per store, plus extras (print on quality cardstock)
- [ ] **Business cards:** Mike's AND your own
- [ ] **Referral cards:** 20+ per store
- [ ] **Partnership agreements:** 3-5 printed copies
- [ ] **Calculator loaded:** Trade-in calculator open on phone, ready to demo
- [ ] **Notepad & pen:** For contact info and notes

### Professional Appearance
- [ ] **Dress code:** Business casual minimum
- [ ] **Clean appearance:** Hair, clothes, shoes presentable
- [ ] **Confident posture:** Stand tall, make eye contact
- [ ] **Friendly demeanor:** Smile, be approachable

---

## Best Times to Visit

### DO Visit:
- **Tuesday - Thursday**, between **10am-11am** or **2pm-4pm**
- After the morning rush, before the afternoon picks up
- Mid-week when managers are more likely to be present

### DON'T Visit:
- **Monday mornings** (busiest, staff catching up)
- **Saturday afternoons** (peak customer time)
- **Lunch rush** (12pm-1pm, staff is busy or on break)
- **Last hour before closing** (staff wrapping up)

---

## Mindset Before Walking In

### Your Attitude
> "I'm here to help you close more sales. That's it."

You're not selling something they don't need. You're offering a solution to a problem they already have. Every store loses sales because of cracked screens. You're offering to fix that.

### Key Reminders
1. **You have value to offer** — This isn't cold calling, it's problem-solving
2. **They can say no** — And that's okay. Move on to the next
3. **You're building relationships** — Even a "no" today can be a "yes" later
4. **Be genuinely helpful** — Don't be pushy, be useful

---

# SECTION 4: THE 5-MINUTE PITCH SCRIPT

## The Complete Conversation Flow

### STEP 1: THE APPROACH (30 seconds)

*Walk in confidently. Look for the manager or most senior employee on the floor. Make eye contact and smile.*

**Say this:**

> "Hi there! Is the manager available? I'm [YOUR NAME] from MyCo Consulting — I work with Gadget Fix, the phone repair shop just down the road.
>
> I've got a quick idea that could help you close more upgrade sales. Do you have 3 minutes?"

**If manager isn't available:**

> "No problem! When's a good time to catch them? I've got something that helps stores close more sales."

*Get their name and best time. Leave a flyer. Note it down. Move on.*

---

### STEP 2: THE HOOK (30 seconds)

*Once you have their attention, identify the problem they already know exists.*

**Say this:**

> "Quick question — how often do customers come in wanting to trade in their phone for an upgrade, but the screen is cracked?"
>
> *[Pause — let them answer]*
>
> "Right? And you either have to turn them away or offer a much lower trade-in value. Frustrating for everyone — especially when they walk out without buying."

---

### STEP 3: THE SOLUTION (60 seconds)

*Now present the solution. Pull out your phone with the calculator ready.*

**Say this:**

> "What if you could send those customers to get their screen fixed in 15-20 minutes, and they come back ready for full trade-in value?
>
> Gadget Fix is literally [X] minutes from here. They specialize in iPhone screen repairs. Most are done while the customer waits.
>
> Here's the cool part..."
>
> *[Show calculator on phone — walk through an example]*
>
> "Let's say someone comes in with a cracked iPhone 16. Right now they'd get maybe $180 on trade-in. But watch this:
>
> - They pay $139 for the screen repair
> - They come back, trade in for $400
> - That's $81 extra in their pocket — AFTER paying for the repair!
>
> You get to complete the sale. They get a better deal. Mike at Gadget Fix gets a customer. Everyone wins."

---

### STEP 4: THE ASK (60 seconds)

*Make it easy to say yes. No big commitment.*

**Say this:**

> "I'm not asking for anything complicated. Just:
>
> 1. Keep a few of our flyers at the counter or in the break room
> 2. When a customer has a cracked screen affecting their trade-in, mention Gadget Fix
> 3. That's it.
>
> We can also set up a referral bonus — $5 to $10 for each customer you send who completes a repair. Totally optional, whatever works for you.
>
> Can I leave some flyers with you?"

---

### STEP 5: THE CLOSE (60 seconds)

*Get buy-in and next steps.*

**If they say YES:**

> "Awesome! Here are some flyers. And here's Mike's card if anyone has questions — he's the owner, super responsive.
>
> I'll check back in a couple weeks to see how it's going and if you need more materials.
>
> What's the best way to reach you? Email or text?"
>
> *[Write down their contact info]*
>
> "Thanks so much! Looking forward to a great partnership."

**If they need to "check with someone":**

> "Totally understand. Here's info you can share with your manager. Can I get your email to follow up in a few days?"

---

## Key Numbers to Memorize

Memorize these — you'll use them constantly:

| iPhone Model | Cracked Trade-In | Repair Cost | Fixed Trade-In | Customer Profit |
|--------------|------------------|-------------|----------------|-----------------|
| **iPhone 16 Pro Max** | $250 | $179 | $550 | **+$121** |
| **iPhone 16 Pro** | $200 | $159 | $480 | **+$121** |
| **iPhone 16** | $180 | $139 | $400 | **+$81** |
| **iPhone 15 Pro Max** | $180 | $149 | $380 | **+$51** |
| **iPhone 15 Pro** | $150 | $129 | $320 | **+$41** |
| **iPhone 15** | $120 | $109 | $250 | **+$21** |

**Pro Tip:** Use iPhone 16 as your go-to example — it's current and the math is easy to remember.

---

## The Magic Phrase

When in doubt, use this:

> **"We just want to help you close more sales. That's really it."**

This phrase works because:
- It's about THEM, not you
- It's simple and honest
- It removes the "what's the catch?" suspicion

---

# SECTION 5: OBJECTION HANDLING GUIDE

## Common Objections & Word-for-Word Responses

### "We already have a repair partner."

> "That's great! We're not looking to replace anyone. We just want to be an additional option for your customers — specifically for trade-in situations. Think of it as giving your customers more choices. Can we be a backup option?"

---

### "I need to check with my manager / corporate."

> "Totally understand — chain of command matters. Here's some info you can share with them. It's really just about keeping some flyers available, nothing official.
>
> What's the best way for me to follow up? I can send an email with all the details."

---

### "We don't do referrals."

> "No problem at all — the referral bonus is completely optional. Even just having our flyers available when a customer has a cracked screen helps. It's really about giving your customers a solution and helping you close more sales. Can I leave some flyers?"

---

### "Customers won't want to leave and come back."

> "That's a fair point. But here's what we've found: most repairs take just 15-20 minutes. Some customers browse around while they wait. And when they realize they'll get an extra $80-150 on their trade-in? That 20-minute trip becomes totally worth it.
>
> Plus, they come back happier and ready to buy."

---

### "What's in it for us?"

> "Great question. Three things:
>
> 1. **You close more upgrade sales.** Instead of losing that customer, they come back ready to buy.
> 2. **Happier customers.** They feel like you helped them get a better deal.
> 3. **Optional bonus.** If you want, we can do $5-10 per referral who completes a repair.
>
> But really, it's about not losing those upgrade sales."

---

### "How do I know you're legit?"

> "Great question — you should ask that! Here's our website... *[show on phone]*
>
> We offer a 90-day warranty on all repairs. Mike, the owner, has been in phone repair for years and has great Google reviews. Feel free to call him directly — he's happy to answer any questions.
>
> We're just a small local business trying to help other local businesses."

---

### "We're really busy right now."

> "I totally get it — I'll be quick. Can I just leave some flyers and my card? I'll swing by another time when it's calmer. When's usually a slower time for you?"

---

### "The carrier has policies against this."

> "I understand — you have to follow corporate guidelines. We're not asking for an official partnership or to be endorsed. It's really just... if a customer asks what they can do about their cracked screen, you might mention there's a repair shop nearby. Totally informal.
>
> But I get it if that doesn't work. Can I at least leave my card in case things change?"

---

## When to Walk Away

Not every store will be a good fit. Walk away gracefully if:

- They're clearly not interested and getting annoyed
- They have a corporate policy that genuinely prohibits it
- The manager is hostile or dismissive

**What to say:**

> "I totally understand. Thanks for your time! If things ever change, here's my card. Have a great day!"

Always leave on a positive note. Situations change, and you might be back.

### Template 1: After a Positive Meeting

**Subject:** Great meeting you today — Gadget Fix partnership

```
Hi [NAME],

Thanks for taking a few minutes to chat today! I really appreciate you 
hearing me out.

As I mentioned, Gadget Fix is right here in Kent Station, and we 
specialize in quick iPhone screen repairs. Our whole thing is helping 
customers get more value on their trade-ins — which means you close 
more upgrade sales.

Here's a quick recap:
• Most repairs take 15-30 minutes
• Customers typically profit $80-150 after paying for the repair
• We can set up a referral bonus if you're interested

I've attached a one-page overview with all the details. Feel free to 
share it with your team or manager.

I'll check back in a couple of weeks to see how things are going. In 
the meantime, if you have any questions, just reply to this email or 
call Mike directly at (253) 639-4343.

Thanks again!

[YOUR NAME]
Gadget Fix | (253) 639-4343

### Template 2: Following Up on a "Maybe"

**Subject:** Quick follow-up — Gadget Fix partnership

```
Hi [NAME],

I stopped by [STORE NAME] a couple of weeks ago to talk about a 
partnership with Gadget Fix. You mentioned you'd want to check with 
your manager first.

Just wanted to follow up and see if there's any interest in moving 
forward. Happy to answer any questions or provide more info.

Quick reminder of what we're offering:
• Flyers/materials for your counter (no cost to you)
• Optional referral bonus ($5-10 per customer)
• 15-minute repairs for your customers with cracked screens
• You close more upgrade sales

Let me know if there's a better time to stop by again, or if an email/
call works better.

Thanks!

[YOUR NAME]
Gadget Fix | (253) 639-4343
```

### Template 3: Re-Engaging a Cold Lead

**Subject:** Still here if you need us — Gadget Fix

```
Hi [NAME],

I know it's been a while since we last spoke about Gadget Fix. Things 
get busy — I totally get it.

Just wanted to pop back in and let you know we're still here if you 
ever want to revisit the partnership idea. We've had some great success 
with other stores in the area, and I think there's real potential here.

No pressure at all. Just wanted to stay on your radar.

If you'd like to chat, I'm always available at [YOUR EMAIL] or 
(253) 639-4343.

Have a great week!

| **Day 1** | Read this entire playbook | Understand the strategy |
| **Day 2** | Memorize the 5-minute pitch script | Practice out loud |
| **Day 3** | Memorize key numbers (trade-in values) | Know them cold |
| **Day 4** | Role-play with Mike or experienced rep | Get comfortable |
| **Day 5** | Shadow an experienced rep on visits | Observe in action |

### Week 2: Supervised Execution

| Day | Activity | Goal |
|-----|----------|------|
| **Day 1** | Do first solo visit (low-priority store) | Get real experience |
| **Day 2** | Debrief with manager, identify improvements | Learn from mistakes |

### Week 3+: Independent Execution

- Full autonomy on store visits
- Weekly check-ins with manager
- Monthly performance review

## Role-Play Scenarios

Practice these scenarios before going into the field:

### Scenario 1: The Interested Manager
*They're curious and asking questions. Practice answering smoothly.*

### Scenario 2: The Skeptic
*They don't believe the numbers. Practice using the calculator demo.*

### Scenario 3: The "Too Busy" Brush-Off
*They don't want to talk. Practice leaving gracefully with materials.*

### Scenario 4: The Corporate Policy Objection
*They say it's against rules. Practice the informal workaround.*

### Scenario 5: The "What's In It For Me?" Employee
*They want to know about the referral bonus. Practice explaining it.*
