---

## THE 5-MINUTE PITCH

### STEP 1: THE APPROACH (30 seconds)

> *Walk in confidently. Look for the manager or most senior employee on the floor. Make eye contact and smile.*

**Say this:**

> "Hi there! Is the manager available? I'm Taylor from MyCo Consulting — I work with Gadget Fix, the phone repair shop just down the road.
>
> I've got a quick idea that could help you close more upgrade sales. Do you have 3 minutes?"

**If manager isn't available:**
> "No problem! When's a good time to catch them? I've got something that helps stores close more sales."

*Get name and best time. Leave a flyer. Move on.*

---

### STEP 2: THE HOOK (30 seconds)

> *Once you have their attention, identify the problem they already know exists.*

**Say this:**

> "Quick question — how often do customers come in wanting to trade in their phone for an upgrade, but the screen is cracked?"
>
> *[Pause — let them answer]*
>
> "Right? And you either have to turn them away or offer a much lower trade-in value. Frustrating for everyone — especially when they walk out without buying."

---

### STEP 3: THE SOLUTION (60 seconds)

> *Now present the solution. Pull out your phone with the calculator ready.*

**Say this:**

> "What if you could send those customers to get their screen fixed in 15-20 minutes, and they come back ready for full trade-in value?
>
> Gadget Fix is literally [X] minutes from here. They specialize in iPhone screen repairs. Most are done while the customer waits.
>
> Here's the cool part..."
>
> *[Show calculator on phone — walk through an example]*
>
> "Let's say someone comes in with a cracked iPhone 16. Right now they'd get maybe $180 on trade-in. But watch this:
>
> - They pay $139 for the screen repair
> - They come back, trade in for $400
> - That's $81 extra in their pocket — AFTER paying for the repair!
>
> You get to complete the sale. They get a better deal. Mike at Gadget Fix gets a customer. Everyone wins."

---

### STEP 4: THE ASK (60 seconds)

> *Make it easy to say yes. No big commitment.*

**Say this:**

> "I'm not asking for anything complicated. Just:
>
> 1. Keep a few of our flyers at the counter or in the break room
> 2. When a customer has a cracked screen affecting their trade-in, mention Gadget Fix
> 3. That's it.
>
> We can also set up a referral bonus — $5 to $10 for each customer you send who completes a repair. Totally optional, whatever works for you.
>
> Can I leave some flyers with you?"

---

### STEP 5: THE CLOSE (60 seconds)

> *Get buy-in and next steps.*

**If they say YES:**

> "Awesome! Here are some flyers. And here's Mike's card if anyone has questions — he's the owner, super responsive.
>
> I'll check back in a couple weeks to see how it's going and if you need more materials.
>
> What's the best way to reach you? Email or text?"
>
> *[Write down their contact info]*
>
> "Thanks so much! Looking forward to a great partnership."

**If they need to "check with someone":**

> "Totally understand. Here's info you can share with your manager. Can I get your email to follow up in a few days?"

---

## Key Numbers to Memorize

| iPhone Model | Cracked Trade-In | Repair Cost | Fixed Trade-In | Customer Profit |
|--------------|------------------|-------------|----------------|-----------------|
| iPhone 16 Pro Max | $250 | $179 | $550 | **+$121** |
| iPhone 16 Pro | $200 | $159 | $480 | **+$121** |
| iPhone 16 | $180 | $139 | $400 | **+$81** |
| iPhone 15 Pro Max | $180 | $149 | $380 | **+$51** |
| iPhone 15 Pro | $150 | $129 | $320 | **+$41** |
| iPhone 15 | $120 | $109 | $250 | **+$21** |

*Use iPhone 16 as your go-to example — it's current and the math is easy to remember.*

# DELIVERABLE 3: OBJECTION HANDLING GUIDE

## Common Objections & Responses

### "We already have a repair partner."

> "That's great! We're not looking to replace anyone. We just want to be an additional option for your customers — specifically for trade-in situations. Think of it as giving your customers more choices. Can we be a backup option?"

---

### "I need to check with my manager / corporate."

> "Totally understand — chain of command matters. Here's some info you can share with them. It's really just about keeping some flyers available, nothing official.
>
> What's the best way for me to follow up? I can send an email with all the details."

---

### "We don't do referrals."

> "No problem at all — the referral bonus is completely optional. Even just having our flyers available when a customer has a cracked screen helps. It's really about giving your customers a solution and helping you close more sales. Can I leave some flyers?"

---

### "Customers won't want to leave and come back."

> "That's a fair point. But here's what we've found: most repairs take just 15-20 minutes. Some customers browse around while they wait. And when they realize they'll get an extra $80-150 on their trade-in? That 20-minute trip becomes totally worth it.
>
> Plus, they come back happier and ready to buy."

---

### "What's in it for us?"

> "Great question. Three things:
>
> 1. **You close more upgrade sales.** Instead of losing that customer, they come back ready to buy.
> 2. **Happier customers.** They feel like you helped them get a better deal.
> 3. **Optional bonus.** If you want, we can do $5-10 per referral who completes a repair.
>
> But really, it's about not losing those upgrade sales."

---

### "How do I know you're legit?"

> "Great question — you should ask that! Here's our website... *[show on phone]*
>
> We offer a 90-day warranty on all repairs. Mike, the owner, has been in phone repair for years and has great Google reviews. Feel free to call him directly — he's happy to answer any questions.
>
> We're just a small local business trying to help other local businesses."

---

### "We're really busy right now."

> "I totally get it — I'll be quick. Can I just leave some flyers and my card? I'll swing by another time when it's calmer. When's usually a slower time for you?"

---

### "The carrier has policies against this."

> "I understand — you have to follow corporate guidelines. We're not asking for an official partnership or to be endorsed. It's really just... if a customer asks what they can do about their cracked screen, you might mention there's a repair shop nearby. Totally informal.
>
> But I get it if that doesn't work. Can I at least leave my card in case things change?"

---

## The Magic Phrase

When in doubt, use this:

> **"We just want to help you close more sales. That's really it."**

**How it works:**
1. Customer comes in
2. Ask: "How did you hear about us?"
3. If they mention a store, note the code
4. At end of month, tally codes and pay bonuses
