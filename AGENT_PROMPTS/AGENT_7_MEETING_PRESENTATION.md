│  WE FOUND SOMETHING                 │
│                                     │
│  Most of your future customers      │
│  don't know they're losing          │
│  HUNDREDS of dollars.               │
│                                     │

│                                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

Speaker Notes:

Here's what we mean..."
```

### Slide 4: The Trade-In Math
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  THE MATH                           │
│                                     │
│  iPhone 16 (cracked screen)         │
│  Trade-in value:         $200       │
│                                     │
│  Screen repair at Gadget Fix:       │
│  Cost:                   -$140      │
│                                     │
│  iPhone 16 (fixed screen)           │
│  Trade-in value:         $480       │
│                                     │
│  ─────────────────────────────────  │
│                                     │
│  CUSTOMER PROFIT:        +$140      │
│                                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

Speaker Notes:
"Look at this. A customer with a cracked iPhone 16 gets $200 
on trade-in. They pay you $140 to fix the screen. Now they 
get $480 on trade-in. They just made $140 by coming to you 
first. You're not just fixing phones - you're making people 
money."
```

### Slide 5: Why This Matters
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  WHY THIS MATTERS                   │
│                                     │
│  • Easy message to communicate      │
│  • Customer has clear incentive     │

│                                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

Speaker Notes:
"This isn't just a fun fact - it's a marketing strategy. 
When customers understand they're actually profiting from 
the repair, it's an easy yes. And it gives us a great story 
to tell carrier stores."
```

### Slide 6: What We Built - Calculator

│                                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

Speaker Notes:
"We also put together a business plan for Gadget Fix. 
[Hand Mike the printed copy] This captures your whole business 
in one place. If you ever need to show a partner, a bank, or 
just want to plan ahead, you've got it documented."
```

### Slide 9: The Partnership Strategy

┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  THE PARTNERSHIP PLAY               │
│                                     │
│  Carrier stores have a problem:     │
│  Customer wants to trade in phone   │
│  → Screen is cracked                │
│  → Can't offer full value           │
│  → Customer is frustrated           │
│  → Store might lose the sale        │
│                                     │
│  YOUR SOLUTION:                     │
│  "Send them to us. 15 minutes.      │
│   They come back ready to upgrade." │
│                                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

Speaker Notes:
"Here's the partnership opportunity. Taylor is going to 
visit carrier stores and pitch them on a simple idea: when 
a customer can't trade in because of a cracked screen, send 
them to you. Everybody wins."
```

### Slide 10: Taylor's Outreach Plan

│                                     │
│  BRONZE SUBSCRIPTION                │
│  $400/month (1-year commitment)     │
│  • Dedicated project manager        │
│  • 1 project at a time              │

│  PARTNERSHIP PROJECT (optional)     │
│  $560 - Taylor's store visits       │
│                                     │

month. That gets you a dedicated team working on your business 
every month. The starter bundle is a one-time $660 to get 
everything set up. And the partnership project is optional -

```

### Slide 13: The ROI
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  THE MATH FOR YOU                   │
│                                     │
│  Your investment: ~$1,000/month     │
│                                     │
│  To break even:                     │
│  10 additional repairs @ $100 avg   │
│  = $1,000 revenue                   │
│                                     │
│  That's ~2-3 extra repairs/week     │
│                                     │
│  Your goal: 10+/week                │
│  Potential upside: $3,000+/month    │
│                                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

Speaker Notes:
"Let's talk ROI. Your investment is about $1,000 a month when 
you average it out. To break even, you need 10 extra repairs 
per month - that's 2-3 per week. Your goal is 10+ per week. 
If we hit that, you're looking at $3,000+ in additional 
monthly revenue."

## DELIVERABLE 3: DEMO SCRIPTS

### Calculator Demo
```
TRADE-IN CALCULATOR DEMO

[Pull out phone, open calculator]

"Mike, let's try this out. Pick a phone - what model do most 
of your customers bring in?"

[Mike answers, e.g., iPhone 16]

"Okay, iPhone 16. And let's say the screen is cracked."

[Select options in calculator]

"Watch this - with a cracked screen, this customer gets 
$180 on trade-in. Not great. But after your repair..."

[Change condition to 'Good']

"...$400. That's a $220 difference. And your repair cost 
is what, about $140?"

[Wait for confirmation]

"So the customer pays you $140 and gets $220 more. They 
just made $80 by coming to you first."

[Show the 'net benefit' display]

"This is what we put on your website. When people see this, 
it's a no-brainer."
```

### Website Demo
```
WEBSITE DEMO

[Open laptop, show mobile version on phone]

"Here's your new website. Let me show you on mobile first - 
that's how 80% of people will see it."

[Show phone to Mike]

"First thing you see - the trade-in value hook. 'Fix your 
screen. Get $200+ more on trade-in.' That's the message 
that's going to bring people in."

[Scroll down]

"Click-to-call button - sticky at the bottom, always visible. 
One tap and they're calling you."

[Continue scrolling]

"Services and pricing - clean, easy to read. Your hours. 
Your location with the map. Reviews section."

## DELIVERABLE 4: OBJECTION RESPONSE GUIDE

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "That's more than I wanted to spend" | "I understand. Let's look at the ROI - you need about 10 extra repairs per month to break even. That's 2-3 per week. Do you think with a website, partnerships, and marketing support, we can get 2-3 more customers per week?" |
| "I need to think about it" | "Of course. What specifically would you want to think about? Maybe I can address it now." |
| "Can I do just the website for now?" | "Absolutely - we can start with just the website if that's more comfortable. It's $100 plus $20/month maintenance. But I'd encourage you to consider the Bronze subscription because you'll have ongoing needs, and it's more cost-effective than paying project by project." |
| "What if the partnerships don't work?" | "Great question. That's exactly why we recommend the subscription model. If partnerships don't pan out, we pivot to something else - maybe social media, maybe Google ads, maybe local events. We keep trying until we find what works." |
| "I've been burned by marketing companies before" | "I hear you, and that's exactly why we're different. We're not going to disappear after taking your money. You've got a dedicated team checking in monthly. And you've already seen the work we can do." |
| "Can I get a discount?" | "The pricing is already pretty lean - we're not a big agency with big overhead. But I can tell you this: if you sign today, we'll include the trade-in calculator for free and throw in an extra month of website maintenance." |

## DELIVERABLE 5: CLOSE SCRIPT

```
THE CLOSE

[After all questions are addressed]

"Mike, let me ask you directly: Does this make sense for 
your business?"

[Wait for response]

If YES:
"Great. I've got the agreement right here. [Hand over agreement] 
Take a look - it's pretty straightforward. The Bronze subscription 
at $400/month, the starter bundle at $660, and we can add the 
partnership project if you want Taylor to start visiting stores."

[Give him time to review]

"Any questions about the terms? ... Okay, if you sign here, 
we're officially partners. First payment, and we're off. 
Website live next week."

If HESITATION:
"I'm sensing some hesitation. What's holding you back?"

[Listen, address concern]

"What would need to happen for you to feel comfortable 
moving forward today?"

If NO / NOT NOW:
"I understand. This is a decision you should feel good about. 
Here's what I'll do - I'll leave all these materials with you. 
Take a few days to think about it. Can we schedule a call 
for [specific date] to follow up?"

[Get commitment to specific follow-up]

"Fair warning though - we're ready to start now. The longer 
we wait, the longer it takes to get those partnerships going 
and customers coming in."
