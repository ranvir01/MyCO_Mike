## DELIVERABLE 2: TAYLOR'S PITCH SCRIPT

### Pre-Visit Checklist
- [ ] Flyers (5 copies)
- [ ] Business cards
- [ ] Phone with calculator loaded
- [ ] Referral tracking cards
- [ ] Notepad for contact info

### The 5-Minute Pitch

**OPENING (30 seconds)**
```
"Hi, is the manager available? I'm Taylor from MyCo Consulting, 
and I work with Gadget Fix, the phone repair shop nearby.

I have a quick idea that could help you close more upgrade sales. 
Do you have 3 minutes?"
```

**THE HOOK (30 seconds)**
```
"How often do customers come in wanting to trade in their phone, 
but they have a cracked screen?

[Wait for response]

Right - and you either have to turn them away or offer a much 
lower trade-in value. Frustrating for everyone."
```

**THE SOLUTION (60 seconds)**
```
"What if you could send those customers to get their screen fixed 
in 15 minutes, and they come back ready to trade in?

Gadget Fix is just [X minutes] away. They specialize in iPhone 
screen repairs. Most repairs are done while the customer waits.

Here's the cool part - 
[Show calculator on phone]

A customer with a cracked iPhone 16 might get $200 trade-in.
After a $140 repair, they get $480 trade-in.
They actually PROFIT $140 by fixing it first.

You get to complete the sale. They get a better deal. We get 
a customer. Everyone wins."
```

**THE ASK (60 seconds)**
```
"I'm not asking for anything complicated. Just:

1. Keep a few of our flyers at the counter
2. When a customer has a cracked screen, mention Gadget Fix
3. That's it.

We can also set up a referral bonus - $5-10 per customer you 
send who gets a repair. Totally optional.

Here are some flyers. Can I leave these with you?"
```

**CLOSING (60 seconds)**
```
"Great! Here's Mike's contact info if you have any questions.
And here's my card - I'll check back in a couple weeks to see 
how it's going.

What's the best way to reach you if we want to set up the 
referral tracking?"

[Get contact info]

"Thanks so much for your time. Looking forward to working 
together!"
```

## DELIVERABLE 3: OBJECTION HANDLING GUIDE

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "We already have a repair partner" | "That's great! We're not asking to replace them. We just want to be an option for your customers. Our focus is specifically on trade-in situations. Can we be a backup?" |
| "I need to check with my manager/corporate" | "Totally understand. Here's some info you can share with them. What's the best way to follow up? I can also email you details." |
| "We don't do referrals" | "No problem - the referral bonus is optional. Even just mentioning us when a customer has a cracked screen helps. Can I leave some flyers?" |
| "Customers won't want to leave and come back" | "Actually, most repairs take 15-30 minutes. Some customers browse while they wait. And getting an extra $100-200 on their trade-in is a great reason to take that time." |
| "What's in it for us?" | "You complete more upgrade sales. Customers leave happier. And if you want, we can set up a $5-10 referral bonus per customer." |
| "How do I know you're legit?" | "Great question. Here's our website [show on phone]. We offer a 90-day warranty on all repairs. Mike, the owner, has been in phone repair for X years. Feel free to call him directly." |
| "We're too busy right now" | "I understand. Can I leave some flyers and a card? I'll check back when things calm down. When's a better time?" |
