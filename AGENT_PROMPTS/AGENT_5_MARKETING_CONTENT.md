🤯 Wait... you're telling me I can MAKE money by fixing my cracked screen?

Here's the math:
📱 iPhone 16 with cracked screen = $200 trade-in
🔧 Screen repair = $140
📱 iPhone 16 with fixed screen = $480 trade-in

You just made $140.

But here's the thing - a $100 repair can get you $200+ MORE.

We're Gadget Fix in Kent. We do screen repairs in 15-30 minutes.
