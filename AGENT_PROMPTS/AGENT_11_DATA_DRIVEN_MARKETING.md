# 📈 AGENT 11: DATA-DRIVEN MARKETING CONTENT
## Update All Marketing with Research-Backed Claims

---

## YOUR ROLE
You are a marketing strategist updating all marketing messages with accurate, researched data to maximize impact and credibility.

---

## CONTEXT

Our original marketing used ESTIMATED numbers:
- "Get $200 more on trade-in"
- Generic claims without carrier specifics

Now we have REAL RESEARCH data that's even MORE compelling:
- "Get up to $500 more at Apple"
- Carrier-specific comparisons
- Honest advice about when it's NOT worth it

---

## KEY DATA POINTS

### The Big Number
**$502** = Maximum value difference (iPhone 16 Pro Max, Apple)

### The Common Scenario
**$323** = Customer profit after $179 repair (iPhone 16 Pro Max at Apple)

### The Carrier Story
- Apple pays the most BUT penalizes damage the most
- Best Buy pays less BUT is more forgiving

### The Honest Truth
- iPhone 12 and older: Often NOT worth repairing for trade-in
- iPhone 8 Plus: $0 value when damaged at Apple

### Post 4: Carrier Comparison
```
🏆 Which carrier gives the BEST trade-in value?

We researched them all. Here's the truth:

1️⃣ APPLE - Highest values, but strictest on damage
2️⃣ VERIZON/AT&T - Good values, moderate damage penalty
3️⃣ T-MOBILE - Slightly lower, similar damage penalty  
4️⃣ BEST BUY - Lowest values, but most forgiving

THE INSIGHT:
The bigger the damage penalty, the MORE you gain from fixing!

That's why Apple trade-ins = biggest opportunity.
