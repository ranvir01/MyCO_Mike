## YOUR ROLE
You are a presentation designer updating a sales pitch deck with accurate, researched data to make the value proposition even more compelling.

## CONTEXT

We now have REAL research data from Taylor's analysis that shows the trade-in opportunity is **MUCH BIGGER** than our original estimates:

**Original claim:** "Get $200 more on trade-in"
**ACTUAL research:** "Get up to $500 more on trade-in at Apple!"

## SLIDES TO UPDATE

### Slide 4: "The Trade-In Math"
**BEFORE:**
```
iPhone 16 (cracked): $200
Repair: $140
iPhone 16 (fixed): $480
PROFIT: $140
```

**AFTER:**
```
iPhone 16 Pro Max at Apple (cracked): $168
Repair at Gadget Fix: $179
iPhone 16 Pro Max at Apple (fixed): $670
────────────────────────────────────────
CUSTOMER PROFIT: $323

That's real money back in their pocket!
```

### NEW Slide: "Carrier Comparison"
```
NOT ALL TRADE-INS ARE EQUAL

iPhone 16 Pro Max with cracked screen:

Apple:     $168 → $670 after repair  [BEST]
AT&T:      $262 → $525 after repair
Verizon:   $262 → $525 after repair
T-Mobile:  $245 → $490 after repair
Best Buy:  $281 → $375 after repair

🎯 PRO TIP: We help customers choose the best trade-in option!
```

### NEW Slide: "The Older Phone Warning"
```
⚠️ NOT EVERY PHONE IS WORTH IT

iPhone 13 and older = Lower trade-in values
iPhone 8 Plus at Apple: Good = $50, Damaged = $0

Our recommendation:
• iPhone 15-16: DEFINITELY repair for trade-in
• iPhone 13-14: Usually worth it
• iPhone 12 and under: Probably not worth it for trade-in
  (but we still fix them if they want to keep using it!)

This honest advice builds TRUST.
```

### Slide 5: "Why This Matters" (Updated)
```
WHY THIS IS A GAME-CHANGER

• $500 opportunity (not $200!)
• Apple pays the most - our customers win
• Clear, honest advice builds trust
• Differentiates from "just another repair shop"
• Creates partnership opportunity with carriers
```

## NEW TALKING POINTS FOR ETHAN

### Opening Hook (Updated)
> "Mike, we found something even bigger than we thought. See this iPhone 16 Pro Max? If a customer trades this in at Apple with a cracked screen, they get $168. But with a fixed screen? $670. That's a $500 difference. Your repair costs what, $179? They're making over $300 profit by coming to you first."

### Carrier Comparison Explanation
> "Here's where it gets interesting. Different carriers value damage differently. Apple is the strictest - they drop the most for a cracked screen. But that means the OPPORTUNITY is biggest with Apple trade-ins. We built a calculator that shows customers exactly which carrier gives them the best deal."

### Honest Advice Angle
> "And here's something that builds trust - we're honest about when it DOESN'T make sense. iPhone 12 and older? The trade-in values are so low it's probably not worth repairing just for trade-in. We tell them that. That honesty makes them trust us more for the phones where it DOES make sense."

---

## DEMO SCRIPT UPDATE

### Calculator Demo (Updated)
```
"Let me show you the calculator with real data.

[Select iPhone 16 Pro Max, Cracked, Apple]

See? $168 current value. That's what they'd get walking in to Apple today.

Now watch this...

[Show fixed value]

$670. That's the real Apple trade-in for this phone in good condition.

Your repair: $179
Their profit: $323

Now let's try AT&T...

[Change to AT&T]

$262 to $525. Still a good deal, but not AS good as Apple.

This is what we show customers. Real numbers. Real research."
```

## OBJECTION HANDLING UPDATE

| Objection | Updated Response |
|-----------|------------------|
| "How do you know these numbers?" | "Taylor, our analyst, researched every major carrier's trade-in program. These are real values from T-Mobile, AT&T, Verizon, Apple, and Best Buy as of November 2024. We can show you the research." |
| "What if the values change?" | "They do change quarterly. That's why we built the calculator - it's easy to update. And it's another reason for ongoing support - we keep the data current." |
| "Apple gives the best values?" | "For good condition phones, yes. But they also penalize damage the most. A cracked screen at Apple loses you $500 in value. That's actually great for your business - the bigger the penalty, the bigger the opportunity." |
