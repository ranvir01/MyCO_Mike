## 🚀 RECOMMENDED EXECUTION ORDER

### Phase 1: Core Deliverables (Run in Parallel)
Run Agents 1-7 simultaneously to create base deliverables.

### Phase 2: Enhancements (Run in Parallel)
Run Agents 8-11 simultaneously to upgrade with real research data.

### Phase 3: Final Assembly (Run LAST)
Run Agent 12 with ALL outputs from Agents 1-11.
Agent 12 collects, verifies, fixes, and packages everything.

**IMPORTANT:** You can run Phases 1 & 2 together (all 11 agents at once).
But Agent 12 MUST run last after you have all outputs.
