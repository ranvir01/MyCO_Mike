**SPEAKER NOTES (Ethan):**
> "Look at this. A customer with a cracked iPhone 16 Pro walks into AT&T - they get maybe $180 on trade-in because the screen is damaged. But if they come to YOU first, pay $140 for the repair, now they get $400 on trade-in. They just made $80 profit by coming to Gadget Fix first. 

> You're not just fixing phones, Mike - you're literally putting money in people's pockets."

> And the partnership project is $560 for Taylor to do the carrier outreach. That one's optional, but honestly, I think it's where the biggest opportunity is."

**SPEAKER NOTES (Ethan):**
> "Let's talk real numbers. Your investment is about $1,000 a month when you average it all out over the year.

> To break even, you need 10 extra repairs per month. That's only 2-3 more per week than you're doing now.

> Your goal is 10 per week. If we get you there, you're looking at $4,000 in additional monthly revenue. Minus our cost, that's $3,000 in your pocket every month that you weren't getting before.

> Does that math make sense to you?"

# 🎮 DEMO SCRIPTS

## Trade-In Calculator Demo

**Setup:** Have calculator open on your phone before this slide

```
SCRIPT:

[Pull out phone, show calculator to Mike]

ETHAN: "Mike, let's try this out together. Pick a phone - 
       what model do most of your customers bring in?"

[Wait for Mike to answer, e.g., "iPhone 16"]

ETHAN: "Okay, iPhone 16. Let's say the screen is cracked."

[Select iPhone 16, select "Cracked Screen" condition]

ETHAN: "Watch this. With a cracked screen, look at this 
       trade-in value..."

[Point to the "cracked" trade-in value: ~$180]

ETHAN: "Not great, right? Now let me change this to 'Good'..."

[Change condition to 'Good']

ETHAN: "...$400. That's a $220 difference."

[Point to the difference]

ETHAN: "Your repair cost for an iPhone 16 screen is what, 
       about $140?"

[Wait for confirmation]

ETHAN: "So the customer pays you $140 and gets $220 more on 
       their trade-in. They just made $80 profit."

[Show the 'net benefit' display if available]

ETHAN: "This is what goes on your website. When people see 
       this, it's a no-brainer to come to you first."

[Hand phone to Mike to play with]

ETHAN: "Go ahead, try another phone."

[Give Mike 30 seconds to interact]
```

**Key Points:**
- Let Mike interact with it
- Use real numbers from his price list if you have them
- Emphasize the "profit" framing

---

## Website Demo

**Setup:** Have website loaded on phone AND laptop

```
SCRIPT:

[Pull out phone, show website on mobile first]

ETHAN: "Here's your new website. Let me show you on mobile 
       first - that's how 80% of your customers will see it."

[Show phone to Mike]

ETHAN: "First thing they see - the hook. 'Fix your screen. 
       Get $200+ more on trade-in.' That's the message that 
       brings them in."

[Scroll down slowly]

ETHAN: "Click-to-call button - see how it sticks to the 
       bottom? One tap and they're calling you."

[Continue scrolling]

ETHAN: "Services and pricing - clean, easy to read. 
       Your hours. Your location with the map."

[Scroll to reviews section if present]

ETHAN: "Reviews section here. We can pull in your Google 
       reviews once you've got more."

[Scroll to bottom]

ETHAN: "Simple contact form at the bottom."

[Pause]

ETHAN: "What do you think? Anything you'd want to change?"

[IMPORTANT: Listen to feedback, write it down]

ETHAN: "Good input. That's the kind of thing we can adjust 
       in week one once we kick off."
```

**Key Points:**
- MOBILE FIRST - show on phone before laptop
- Point out the click-to-call
- Ask for feedback - makes Mike feel ownership
- Note any feedback for later

# 🛡️ OBJECTION RESPONSE GUIDE

## Price Objections

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| **"That's more than I wanted to spend"** | "I understand. Let's look at the ROI together - you need about 10 extra repairs per month to break even. That's 2-3 per week. With a website, partnerships, and Taylor out there hustling, do you think we can get 2-3 more customers per week?" |
| **"Can I just do the website?"** | "Absolutely - we can start with just the website. That's $100 plus $20/month maintenance. But I'd encourage you to consider the Bronze subscription because you'll have ongoing needs. It's more cost-effective than paying project by project." |
| **"Can I get a discount?"** | "The pricing is already pretty lean - we're not a big agency with overhead to cover. But if you sign today, we'll include an extra month of website maintenance free. That's a $20 value as a thank you for moving forward." |

## Timing Objections

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| **"I need to think about it"** | "Of course. What specifically would you want to think about? Maybe I can address it now so you have all the information you need." |
| **"Let me talk to my wife/partner first"** | "Totally understand. When do you think you'd have that conversation? I want to make sure we stay in touch. What if I send you a summary you can share with them?" |
| **"Can we start after the holidays?"** | "We could, but here's the thing - January is when people upgrade phones. The iPhone 17 announcements, New Year's resolutions. If we wait, we miss that wave. If we start now, we're ready to catch it." |

## Trust Objections

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| **"I've been burned by marketing companies before"** | "I hear you, and that's exactly why we're different. First, you've already seen the work - not promises, actual deliverables. Second, we're a subscription model - if we're not delivering value, you'd see that in monthly reviews. We don't disappear after taking your money." |
| **"How do I know the partnerships will work?"** | "Great question. Honestly, I can't guarantee every store says yes. That's why the subscription model is smart - if partnerships don't pan out, we pivot. Maybe it's social media, maybe it's Google ads, maybe it's local events. We keep trying until we find what works." |
| **"You guys seem young/new"** | "Fair point. We are newer, and you're right to ask. That's actually why this deal is good for you - we're hungry. You're our showcase project. When you succeed, that's our proof for future clients. We have every incentive to make you a success story." |

## Alternative Solutions Objections

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| **"I can do the website myself"** | "You probably could. The question is - when? You're running repairs all day. And it's not just about making a website, it's about making one that converts. The trade-in angle, the mobile optimization, the click-to-call. That's what we do." |
| **"My nephew/friend does websites"** | "That's awesome - nothing wrong with saving money. Here's what we bring beyond just the website: the strategy, the partnership outreach, the ongoing support. Would your nephew visit carrier stores on your behalf? Would they update the site monthly and help you figure out what's working?" |

# 🤝 CLOSE SCRIPT

## The Ask

```
[After all questions have been addressed]

ETHAN: "Mike, let me ask you directly: 
       Does this make sense for your business?"

[Wait for response]
```

## If YES / POSITIVE:

```
ETHAN: "Great. I've got the agreement right here."

[Hand over agreement document]

ETHAN: "Take a look - it's pretty straightforward. The 
       Bronze subscription at $400/month, the starter 
       bundle at $660. 

       And if you want Taylor to start visiting stores, 
       that's the partnership project at $560."

[Give Mike time to review - stay quiet]

ETHAN: "Any questions about the terms?"

[Address any questions]

ETHAN: "Okay. Sign here, and we're officially partners. 
       First payment, and we're off. Website live next week."

[Hand pen to Mike]
```

## If HESITATION:

```
ETHAN: "I'm sensing some hesitation. What's holding you back?"

[Listen carefully - don't interrupt]

ETHAN: "I hear you. [Address the specific concern]"

[After addressing]

ETHAN: "What would need to happen for you to feel 
       comfortable moving forward today?"

[Listen and address]
```

## If NO / NOT NOW:

```
ETHAN: "I understand. This is a decision you should 
       feel good about."

[Pause]

ETHAN: "Here's what I'll do - I'll leave all these 
       materials with you. The business plan, the 
       proposal, everything. Take a few days."

[Hand over materials]

ETHAN: "Can we schedule a call for [specific date - 
       within 5 days] to follow up?"

[Get commitment to specific date]

ETHAN: "One thing though - we're ready to start now. 
       The longer we wait, the longer it takes to 
       get those partnerships going and new customers 
       coming in.

       January's when people upgrade phones. If we 
       start now, you're ready to catch that wave."

[Let that sink in]

ETHAN: "So let's talk [confirmed date]. Sound good?"
```
