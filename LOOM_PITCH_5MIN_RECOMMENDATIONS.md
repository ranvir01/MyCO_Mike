## 🟡 SLIDES TO REDO/CONDENSE

### "Who We Are" Section (Slides 10-15)
**Current:** 5+ slides explaining your model
**Recommendation:** Condense to 1 slide

**New Slide Content:**
```
"What Makes Us Different"

✓ We're your project managers, not just contractors
✓ Access to a network of specialists on-demand
✓ Lower costs than agencies, higher quality than DIY
✓ We do the thinking - you get results
```

### "For Example" Section (Slide 20)
**Current:** 4 client testimonial quotes
**Recommendation:** Keep the 2 strongest (Goldstein and Blue Landscaping)

### "Our Process" Section (Slides 25-55) ⚠️ BIGGEST CUT
**Current:** 30 slides with complex flowcharts
**Recommendation:** Reduce to 2-3 slides MAX

**New Slide 1: "Our Process (Simple)"**
```
Step 1: You Tell Us the Problem
Step 2: We Research & Plan
Step 3: We Execute
Step 4: You Get Results
```

**New Slide 2: "What You Get"**
```
✓ Dedicated Project Manager
✓ Access to our network of specialists
✓ Regular check-ins & updates
✓ Deliverables you can use
```

### Contract Terms (Slide 60)
**Recommendation:** Move to end or remove - too detailed for a pitch

---

## 🔴 SLIDES TO CUT COMPLETELY

| Slides | Content | Why Cut |
|--------|---------|---------|
| **30-55** | Detailed process flowcharts | Too academic, overwhelming |
| **45** | Project Scoping diagrams (triangle, cube) | Too corporate/consulting |
| **75-77** | Blue Landscaping case study + values chart | Good content but makes video too long |

## 🎯 SPECIFIC CHANGES TO MAKE

### 1. Simplify the Process Section

**Current (Slide 40):**
```
Project Initiation → Requirements Gathering → Feasibility Analysis → 
Project Formulation → Project Selection → Sourcing Talent →
Liasoning → Work Planning → Budgeting Resources → Project Scheduling
```

**New Version:**
```
Step 1: DISCOVERY
"We learn about your problem"

Step 2: PLANNING  
"We figure out the best solution"

Step 3: EXECUTION
"We do the work (or find people who can)"

Step 4: RESULTS
"You get what you need"
```

### 2. Combine Value Prop Slides

**Current (Slides 10, 15, 25):**
- "Who are we?" 
- "Why do it like this?"
- "Project Lifecycle"

**New Single Slide:**
```
WHY MyCo?

🎯 We're your outsourced project managers
💰 Access talent without hiring full-time
📊 We plan, you decide
🚀 Results-focused, not hours-focused
```

### 3. Add Client-Specific Slide (Optional)

If customizing for Mike/Gadget Fix, add:

```
"Mike's Story"

Mike runs a phone repair shop in Kent.
He wanted more customers.
We found an opportunity worth $300/customer.
Now we're building his growth engine.

→ This is what we do.
```
